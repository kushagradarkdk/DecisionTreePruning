# DecisionTreePruning
This project contains two files. A DecisionTree.py and a Driver.py file. 
I have used two datasets for my analysis. 
These are:  
Iris Dataset. 
Pima-Indian Dataset. 

Here I have introduced a pruning mechanism where I am pruning the generated tree on each internal node and then if the testing accuracy is more for the pruned dataset I am printing the pruned tree along with its accuracy
