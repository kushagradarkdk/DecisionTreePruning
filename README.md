# DecisionTreePruning
This project contains two files. A DecisionTree.py and a Driver.py file.  I have used two datasets for my analysis. These are:  Iris Dataset. Pima-Indian Dataset. Here I have introduced a pruning mechanism where I am pruning the generated tree on each internal node and then if the testing accuracy is more for the pruned dataset I am printing the pruned tree along with its accuracy
